# Overview
This repository contains a microservice-based project learned and inspired from various YouTube tutorials. The project demonstrates the interactions between different microservices, securing them using Okta, and managing the interactions through single gateways.

# Features
Inter-Service Communication: Demonstrates how one microservice interacts with another, ensuring seamless data flow.
Security with Okta: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms for the services using Okta, ensuring only valid users and services can access certain functionalities.
Single Gateways: Utilizes a single gateway approach for routing requests to the appropriate service, offering a unified access point for all services.

# Prerequisites
Java verions 18

Spring Boot 3

Okta Account
